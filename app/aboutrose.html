    <p> 
    My goal is to paint an expression of how I feel about a scene or image that has inspired me. I choose not to make a realistic copy, but one that shows you something that you may not have seen but I think is really wonderful. I do this by selecting certain elements to emphasize and others to minimize, alter, or simply leave out; this creative side of painting happens before my brush touches the paint, and it is the most important time in the painting process. After this, the fun and the magic of painting with oils begins.</p>
